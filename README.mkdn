# File Sharing

## WHAT

File Sharing is a very very simple way to share your files using a web page.
It is a very old project that now has turned public. The source is not in english but it will be translated soon.

## INSTALLING

The install is very simple, you only need to copy the files to your document root in a webserver running PHP.

## USAGE

In the index.php you need to change the line that defines the directory to find all files to share. For example:

	$list="/home/tapajos/public_html/files";
	
The directory should read permission for your webserver user. A good idea is to use the 755 permission.
